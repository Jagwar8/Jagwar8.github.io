          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> As a capstone for my course, I had to find a client, identify a need they had and fulfill their need. I found a Leadership teacher who wanted to be able to streamline their process of sending birthday cards to students on their birthday during the peak of COVID so they felt they were still being recognized by their community. They asked me to make a simple, intuitive program that could be used to send birthday cards to every student in the school on their birthday, and one that could be reused in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since I was dealing with sensitive personal information, I first implemented a CSV reader that would parse a file provided by the client to gather and organize names, birthdays, and email addresses. I then utilized the Paint/Graphics2D classes to create a template for a birthday card that would be saved locally as a PNG, with randomized colors and inserting the student's name and a customized sender along with different embedded fonts. I then set about doing the hardest part, which was utilizing the Selenium webdriver to set up the navigation within Chrome to automatically send all the emails. The program starts with prompting the user to sign in to a Gmail account, then composes an email with predefined text and the student's name filled in. I then used AutoIT to fill in the file path to the generated image and each email would be composed and sent in sequence utilizing the "Schedule Send" feature in Gmail.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> AutoIT, Java (via Netbeans IDE), Selenium Webdriver&nbsp;</p>

							<h3><img src="Page Content/Screenshot 2022-07-31 135914.png" width="800" height="357" alt=""/><strong>Blackjack</strong></h3>
						  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I had to implement a card game along with advanced features such as card counting, as well as keep track of the player's balance and the cards in play.</p>
							<p><strong>Solution:</strong> First, I implemented the bet system and kept a running balance of the bet as well as the money on hand. I then implemented win/loss conditions for the game and then first made the game's functionality with placeholder elements, then implemented classes to keep track of the cards in play and what constituted a win or loss. Afterwards, I fleshed out the UI with the proper icons and colors, and then spent the rest of the time refining the card counting and hint system.</p>
							<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Java and Swing UI (via Netbeans IDE)</p>

							<h3><img src="Page Content/Screenshot 2022-07-31 154133.png" width="800" height="522" alt=""/><strong>CyberPrison Escape Game</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I had to go through a full game development process, from concept to sketches/whiteboxing to a final game operating on WebGL developed in Unity3D.</p>
							<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The first step was to model the scene and set up the animation sets and triggers for the characters and items. I then worked on coding a third person controller that would control both the camera and player movement, as well as a NavMesh for the enemy AI and particle/sound systems to add depth to the game. Lastly, I added tutorial text as well as win/loss conditions that would allow different outcomes for the game based on cause of death, health, etc.</p>
							<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Visual Studio C# IDE, Unity, Maya</p>

							<h3><img src="Page Content/Screenshot 2022-07-31 160401.png" width="800" height="667" alt=""/><strong>WIP Album Designs+Music</strong></h3>
						  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> I worked on setting up a SoundCloud account and accompanying art, including banners and album covers, as well as original music.</p>
							<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I had first created and mixed the music in Magix Music Maker, and made vector thumbnails for each track based on the theme of the song in Illustrator. I then made the profile picture and background in Photoshop.&nbsp;My approach here was to make it as barebones as possible to reflect the stripped-down "work in progress" theme of the account.</p>
							<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Magix Music Maker, Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop</p>
